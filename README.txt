**Inspiration**
We were inspired to create this project because environmental damage and climate change have been heavily affecting animals across the globe. Habitats are being destroyed and human induced diseases are wiping out mass populations. We also wanted to bridge the gap between the virtual and physical world because a TED Talk done by Jane McGonigal discussed how a "gamer mindset" is highly beneficial for getting things done. They are motivated by the constant desire to accomplish more and level up. Recovocolor is open to people of all ages, and we can help build a better world one pixel at a time.

**What it does**
Recovocolor is not an ordinary pixel art coloring app. The amount of pixels in a picture is determined by the number of animals left in that species. In other words, the more endangered an animal is, the lesser the amount of pixels it will be composed of and the more “blurry” it will be. You can collect coins and experience to unlock new pictures.

**How we built it**
We built this app through the AppLab from code.org. We also used echoAR for the augmented reality model.

**Challenges we ran into**
We struggled on developing the concept for the app but eventually bounced our ideas back and forth enough to have something we were all passionate about making.

**What we learned**
We learned a lot about time management and what it takes to work together in a team to create an app. We learned how to divide up the tasks and help each other to develop something we all came to love.

**What's next for recovocolor**
With more time and coding we hope to improve our app by implementing the pixel-coloring feature. We also want to implement “daily quests” that can inspire the user to make subtle changes in their life to help the endangered wildlife.
